query ($random: Int) {
  Page(page: $random, perPage: 1) {
    pageInfo {
      total
    }
    media(type: ANIME, isAdult: false, status_not: NOT_YET_RELEASED) {
      id
    }
  }
}

you run this once without passing a random variable. You take the value of pageInfo.total, 
generate a random number with that as the upper bound, you run the same query again, 
but pass your random number as the random variable, you take the Page.media[0] value as your random anime.
